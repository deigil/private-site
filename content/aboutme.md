## A short biography

Well, where should I start.. My name is **Deimantas**, A.K.A **Dei** and I am a 22 year old, born and raised in a small country in Europe. Only 3 million people live here, maybe less now 😯 but it is very beautiful, clean, and where half of my childhood was 🇱🇹.

The history of this country is also quite spectacular and worth looking into!

But besides where I am from lets talk about how I got into the tech realm. Ever since I was young we had an old windows vista laptop I would play web games on. Now video games do not necessarily make you *techy* for lack of a better term but it was a start.

Once in America my parents decided to get me a pre-built gaming desktop and thats where things really took off. I began to dabble in the android realm and really modify my phone. I remember having an old Motorola smartphone and unlocking the boot-loader, flashing custom firmware, and overall *hacking* it.

Most phones ive had since then have been modified extensively. I am on a pixel 8 right now and already unlocked [bootloader](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking), flashed custom [crDroid os](https://crdroid.net/), and rooted it with [magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk). Click on any of those things to find out more about them! 

### Freedom = Android > iOS 😆

My parents began to sign me up for coding boot-camps even before highschool due to my interest. I started to learn about programming languages and by the time I was **in** highschool, I already knew quite a bit about c++, python, and java. Fast-forward in time and I am a masters student at the [prestigious tech university here in Chicago](https://www.iit.edu/)!
