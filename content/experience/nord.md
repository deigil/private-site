# Site Reliability Engineer

My internship at Nord Security was a game-changer. I got to work on their massive global infrastructure - we're talking over 5,000 servers worldwide! As part of the SRE team, I spent my days building Django web apps for their production and QA environments, keeping critical services running smoothly, and wrestling with Docker containers until they behaved.

The highlight was definitely automating all the repetitive server tasks with Bash scripts and building out solid backup systems for their SQL databases. It was stressful at times (infrastructure at this scale is no joke), but incredibly rewarding to see everything running like clockwork. This experience really opened my eyes to how enterprise-level DevOps actually works in the real world.
