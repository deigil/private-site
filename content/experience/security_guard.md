# Security Guard

Working security at Sauliu Namai Banquet Hall has been quite the experience! It's a small family-owned Lithuanian banquet hall in Chicago, and I've been keeping an eye on things since 2021. Most nights are pretty chill - checking IDs, making sure the parking lot is secure, keeping an eye on the crowd during weddings and events.

But every now and then things get interesting. I've had to talk down a few heated situations (wedding drama is real!), and it's amazing how just staying calm and talking things through can prevent things from escalating. The owners noticed I knew my way around computers, so I ended up building them a proper website using Google Sites with their own custom domain. Who knew security work would involve web development too?
