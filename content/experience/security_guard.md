# Un-armed Security

- **Organization:** Sauliu Namai Banquet Hall Â· Part-time
- **Duration:** Jan 2021 - Present
- **Location:** Chicago, Illinois, United States

Aiming to complete armed security guard training! Currently an un-armed security guard for a small family owned banquet hall on the south west side of Chicago called [**Sauliu Namai**](https://www.sauliu-namai.org). I actually made their website seen below with a simple google site and custom DNS!

Besides that, I had to deal with multiple interactions that unfortunately, could have gone bad. With my presence and de-escalation skills, the conflicts were peacefully resolved and no harm has ever come to the guests or myself at an event.

**Skills:**

- Communication
- De-escalation
- Public Safety
