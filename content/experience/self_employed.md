# Freelance Developer & Systems Administrator

Being self-employed as a developer and sysadmin has been a wild ride. I've taught myself everything through trial and error, late nights debugging, and plenty of "what the heck is going on here" moments. My home server setup is basically my digital playground - running on Arch Linux with some Ubuntu bits, it's hosting Minecraft servers that people play on from all over the world, plus a bunch of other services I've tinkered with.

I've built all sorts of automation scripts in Bash and Python to make my life easier, created websites using Django and Flask, and gotten really good at Docker for containerizing everything. The coolest part is my Discord-integrated monitoring system - I can check server status and restart services just by chatting in a Discord channel. Super handy when you're troubleshooting at 2 AM!

Beyond the technical stuff, I also do computer repairs, network setup, camera installations, and website design for local clients. It's kept me busy and taught me that every client has a different "computer problem" that's usually not actually about computers.

You can view most of my projects on the [Projects](/projects/) page.
