# Bring Together Lithuania

I completed the Bring Together Lithuania summer program, which included an internship at Nord Security and an opportunity to re-discover my home country as a young adult. The program offered remarkable experiences, including meetings with the presidential administration, a conversation with the First Lady, and visits to numerous cultural and historical museums throughout the country. This immersive experience deepened my connection to my Lithuanian heritage and broadened my perspective on international relations, cultural preservation, and civic engagement.
