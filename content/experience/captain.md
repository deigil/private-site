I am licensed under the United States Coast Guard "USCG 25 Ton Masters" license. I am captain of a 35ft sail boat named "harmony" ðŸŒ… in the Monroe Harbor, Chicago. My job is to take customers out to the lake and make sure they have a good and safe time. Communication and peoples skills are very important here. One notable accomplishment is my review rate with multiple perfect reviews!
