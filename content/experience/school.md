# My IIT Journey

## üë®‚Äçüéì Illinois Institute of Technology

### Bachelor of Science - Computer Engineering

My undergrad journey at IIT was a wild ride of discovery and growth. I started as a wide-eyed freshman in 2020, right before everything went remote due to the pandemic, and somehow managed to graduate in 2025 while already working on my master's. The co-terminal program was a lifesaver - it let me double-dip on credits and get both degrees faster, though it meant I was basically a professional student for 5 straight years.

Academically, I got to explore everything from building circuits from scratch to diving deep into computer architecture. The networking classes were my favorite - we did actual hands-on projects with Cisco equipment and learned how to secure networks, which eventually led me to get my ISC2 certification. I also fell in love with cybersecurity during those classes.

But college wasn't just about hitting the books. I jumped into volleyball right away (hey, I'm Lithuanian - it's basically in our blood!), playing on the NCAA D3 team my freshman year and then sticking with the club team. Later I got into esports and led the Rocket League team for two years, which was hilarious because I went from spiking volleyballs to clutching digital car soccer matches. The IPRO courses were also amazing - real interdisciplinary projects where engineering, business, and design students had to work together to create actual products. One of my favorites was building a smart home system that actually worked in the real world.

Looking back, undergrad taught me that engineering isn't just about the technical stuff - it's about solving real problems for real people, and that sometimes the best solutions come from the most unexpected collaborations.

### Master of Science - Computer Engineering

My master's experience at IIT was a perfect blend of deep technical learning and real-world problem-solving. I specialized in Networking and Telecommunications, which was perfect since I'm fascinated by how the internet actually works under the hood. The coursework was intense - we dove into everything from 5G architecture to machine learning, and I particularly loved the FPGA design classes where I got to build actual hardware.

But the real highlight was definitely RiskWatch. This project started as a class assignment but turned into something much bigger. We built a wearable device that could detect falls in elderly people and automatically alert caregivers - think of it as a high-tech lifeline. Working on this for two years taught me more about product development, user experience, and working in a multidisciplinary team than any textbook ever could. We actually won 2nd place in the Grainger Innovation Prize competition and walked away with a $10,000 award! Plus, we got to publish a research paper about it, which was pretty surreal for a group of grad students.
