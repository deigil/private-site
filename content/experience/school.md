# My University Experience

## 👨‍🎓 Illinois Institute of Technology

### Master of Science - MS, Computer Engineering

- **Duration:** Jan 2023 - May 2025
 - **Grade:** 3.40
 - **Activities and societies:** Grainger Innovation Competition; RiskWatch Research Paper
 - **Details:** I hold my Master’s in Computer Engineering, with a specialization in Networking and Telecommunications from IIT. Throughout my graduate studies, I consistently achieved high academic honors, making the Dean’s List in both Spring and Fall 2023. My coursework included advanced topics such as 5G Architecture, Wireless Networks and Protocols, Advanced Computer Networks, Machine Learning, and Digital System-on-Chip Design with FPGAs to name a few. These classes were complemented by projects that emphasized real-world and collaborative engineering.

   A major focus of my graduate experience was a two-year continuation of a project called RiskWatch: a portable wrist monitoring system designed for elderly users to detect falls and provide real-time updates to family members and caregivers via a mobile app, Bluetooth beacons, and more. This project earned 2nd place in the Grainger Innovation Prize competition, winning a $10,000 award, and was the subject of a published research paper.

### Bachelor's degree, Computer Engineering

- **Duration:** Aug 2020 - Mar 2025
 - **Grade:** 3.36
 - **Activities and societies:** NCAA D3 Volleyball Team · Volleyball Club · Esports · IPRO · Grainger

During my undergraduate studies at IIT, I pursued a comprehensive curriculum spanning electrical engineering, networking, computer science, and mathematics. In my third year, I was accepted into the co-terminal program, allowing me to work toward both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees simultaneously. This dual-degree path required strong organization and time management as I balanced a demanding academic load each semester.
 
My coursework included circuit design (three levels), signals and systems, VLSI design, and extensive studies in networking—such as computer network fundamentals and network security, which involved hands-on CISCO packet tracer projects. These experiences sparked my interest in cybersecurity and led me to earn my first ISC2 certification. In computer science, I covered object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, discrete structures, computer architecture, operating systems, and more. My studies were further rounded out by advanced mathematics and three levels of physics, providing a solid technical foundation.

Beyond the classroom, I participated in two IPRO (Interprofessional Project) courses, where my teams developed real, viable products. You can view these and other projects in my [LinkedIn Projects section](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dei-gil/details/projects?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADaXQC0BQk0o9GkHUd8hoSRENI2mgQfUFOY&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3Bagb9JoPmQjGJHlBIz5xzFQ%3D%3D). Both fostered cross-disciplinary collaboration and practical problem-solving skills.

Extracurricularly, I played on the NCAA D3 Men’s Volleyball team during my first year, later joined the club volleyball team, and led the IIT Esports Rocket League team for two years, further developing my leadership and teamwork abilities.

Overall, my undergraduate experience at IIT was both focused and diverse, equipping me with a broad and adaptable skill set to tackle complex, real-world challenges.
