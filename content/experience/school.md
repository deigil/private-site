In my time as a bachelors student my studies were very streamlined yet still broad enough to where I can experience and learn a lot of different topics. Things like electrical engineering such as circuit design (3 levels), signals and systems, VLSI design. I also learned a lot about networking in my undergrad with classes on computer network introduction and network security. This involved CISCO packet tracer projects which was another good introduction to cyber security and what pushed me to get my first certification with ISC2. There was also a lot of CS including but not limited to object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, discrete structures, computer architecture, operating systems, and more. Math lasted most of my years as an undergrad with 3 levels of physics as well. Overall a mighty combination of experience and knowledge to tackle problems that this era might bring.
