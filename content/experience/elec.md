# Electrical Engineer

Working at H.B. Taylor Co. was where I really dove into the world of industrial automation. I spent most of my time programming Automation Direct PLC controllers - those things are fascinating because they're basically tiny computers that control massive manufacturing machines. I'd write the logic that tells conveyor belts when to start/stop, monitors sensors, and basically automates all the repetitive stuff that used to require someone standing there pushing buttons all day.

But it wasn't all just coding from a desk - I also got my hands dirty with electrical wiring for new installations and spent hours in AutoCAD Electrical drawing up schematics. The best part was seeing a system go from a bunch of drawings on paper to a fully functioning automated production line. It really clicked for me how software and hardware have to work together perfectly in manufacturing - one wrong connection and the whole line stops!

**Skills:**

- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Programming
- Industrial Automation
- AutoCAD Electrical
- Electrical Wiring & Installation
- Control Systems Design
