# Mechanical Engineer

My mechanical engineering gig at H.B. Taylor Co. was all about the full project lifecycle - I'd show up, set everything up from scratch, make sure it ran smoothly, and then break it all down when the project wrapped up. The highlight was definitely installing their factory surveillance system. I spent days mounting cameras, running cables, and configuring the software to make sure we had eyes on every corner of the facility.

But it wasn't all high-tech stuff - I also did plenty of data entry, kept track of equipment inventory, and helped with general facility upkeep. Working in manufacturing really taught me about attention to detail - one loose bolt or misplaced tool can shut down an entire production line. Plus, I got to see firsthand how all the different engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) have to work together to make things actually work.

**Skills:**

- Project Management
- Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP)
- Computer Hardware
- Computer Repair
- Surveillance Systems
- Facility Maintenance
