# Tender Driver

Working as a tender driver at Burnham Park Yacht Club was a perfect mix of my love for boating and getting to flex my tech skills. Most days I was shuttling yacht club members back and forth between the mainland and their boats on Lake Michigan - the views were incredible and I got to chat with some fascinating people.

But the real fun started when their ancient point-of-sale system started acting up. They asked if I could help since I had some tech background, and next thing I know I'm knee-deep in reprogramming their old POS software and fixing Windows Server issues that were causing the whole system to crash during dinner rush. It was stressful keeping the restaurant running while I debugged, but super satisfying to see the system working smoothly again. Who knew boat driving would lead to IT heroics?
