I worked as a tender drive for a yacht club called [**Burnham Park Yacht Club**](https://www.bpyc.com/). Although I was just a tender driver my technological skill was put into use and I reprogrammed their old POS (point of sale) systems, fixed windows server issues, and overall assisted in other club operations.
