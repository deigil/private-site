# Office Administrator & Technology Lead

My time at the Lithuanian Cultural School of Chicago was a crash course in wearing many hats! I started as the office admin guy helping with paperwork and schedules, but pretty quickly became the unofficial tech guru since I was the only one who could fix the computers when they broke.

I ended up managing everything tech-related - fixing printers when they jammed (which happened way too often), setting up computers for new teachers, maintaining the audio systems, and making sure the projectors worked for school events. The big school celebrations were always my favorite though - I'd spend hours setting up the AV equipment so the traditional Lithuanian dances and music performances would look and sound amazing. Nothing beats the feeling of nailing that perfect sound mix right before a performance starts!

**Skills:**

- Office Administration
- Technology Leadership
