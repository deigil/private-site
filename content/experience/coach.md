# Head Volleyball Coach

Getting back to Jones College Prep as Head Coach for the Boys Varsity Volleyball team has been pretty surreal - I used to play here back in high school and won championships as a player. This season we took home the Regional Championship title, which felt incredible since it was my first year coaching varsity.

I try to bring what I learned from my own playing days (college D3 and semi-pro) into practice. We spend a lot of time on fundamentals and mental toughness - I want these kids to understand that volleyball isn't just about the physical game, it's about building character and learning to push through tough moments. Each player gets personalized attention during our one-on-one sessions, and watching them grow both as athletes and people makes every practice worth it.
