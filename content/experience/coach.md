# Head Volleyball Coach

- **Organization:** Chicago Public Schools ¬∑ Part-time
- **Duration:** Oct 2024 - Present
- **Location:** Chicago, Illinois, United States ¬∑ On-site

As the Head Coach of the Boys Varsity Volleyball team at Jones College Prep in downtown Chicago, I led the team to a Regional Championship title in my first season (Spring 2025). Drawing on my own playing experience at the collegiate and semi-professional levels, I focus on developing players both individually and as a team. I design and run customized, high-intensity drills tailored to each athlete‚Äôs needs, and provide consistent one-on-one feedback to promote growth, discipline, and competitive performance. My coaching philosophy emphasizes technical development, mental resilience, and accountability both on and off the court.
