Welcome to my projects page! Here you'll find a curated list of the projects I'm most proud of. I'm passionate about building things that are not only functional but also well-designed and enjoyable to use. My interests are broad and include everything from web development and backend systems to automation and data science.

Below, you'll find a mix of personal projects, open-source contributions, and professional work. Each project has a brief description, a link to the code or live version, and a list of the technologies I used.
