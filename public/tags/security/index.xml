      <description>Un-armed Security Organization: Sauliu Namai Banquet Hall Â· Part-time Duration: Jan 2021 - Present Location: Chicago, Illinois, United States Aiming to complete armed security guard training! Currently an un-armed security guard for a small family owned banquet hall on the south west side of Chicago. I had to deal with multiple interactions that could have gone bad. With my presence and de-escalation skills, the conflicts were peacefully resolved and no harm has ever come to myself or the guests at an event.</description>
